Three reports on THIS submission.  All bogus.  

On THIS submission.

[So folks...there is me contacting the admins to let them know that y'all are trying to waste moderator time by filing bogus reports on a submission calling for harmony.](https://imgur.com/a/daYB1Wc)

Also, I'm seeing a lot of handwringing by the left here that everyone's not just saying, ""Yes"" to this post and some are expressing frustration with trying to deal with the left.

So...on this my cakeday...have a sampling of some of the comments you DID not see on this post...

And don't forget to thank your mods!!!

"It's so nice to see such a wholesome post in times like these. Thank you. I believe the elites actually enjoy putting dems and reps against each other by pushing the divide and conquer agenda. After all, it's so easy to control the masses when we are constantly fighting against each other.

Like you say, 95% of dems and reps, and I can safely say it's the same anywhere else in the world, want the same things: safety, food, a job, to be happy. People don't naturally hate each other, we are programmed by the media to hate each other, to blame each other for their own problems.

So no, not all the dems are bad people. Your post proves that. If we finally learned to spread love we would finally understand that ""you must love one another"" is not just a nice biblical saying, it's the key for a better, happy society."
"Both sides want a better country.  We like to demonize people on both sides. But in the end we are all Americans.  I voted for Trump because I think he wants that and sees that too.   He just likes to fall into the trap both sides fall into far too often. 

The main stream media wants to paint us all as racists, bigots, and deplorables. Why do you think we don't care when the media calls trump these things. We don't believe it because we heard them say the same things about Romney, Bush, McCain, somehow Ted Cruz even though he's Cuban.

However, I just want to say I don't blame you and I don't want to demonize you. I love you my fellow American."
One of my best friends I have known for a long time is a Democrat but we don’t let that split us. This is a great message to spread around
"That's how our country should be, Ds and Rs together fighting the real issues like holding Congress accountable for once. The stuff they get away with is ridiculous. Endless terms? Sitting in office for 40+ years. The ability to trade stock and vote on that same stock that same day. Voter suppression. Internet privacy laws. Making America an actual free country again."

Folks..."
I *would* be caught dead at a BLM rally with a MAGA hat on.
"Wearing a MAGA cap gets you de facto castigated as a person who is worth abusing. People in the MSM won't outright condone it.. In fact, they'll say they don't condone it but (big ol' BUT) they **understand** why people feel and act that way (right back to condoning it). 

This is why that Catholic school kid is getting all these settlements in libel lawsuits. He was viciously misrepresented on a national stage for the grand crime of wearing a MAGA hat, standing still, and smiling in a public setting."
And that was from before he became President. He posted it in 2014.

This is so true. I can honestly say I haven’t thought about this before.
I’ve always ignored this tradition. I’ve learned a lot.
"I would disagree with this.

The whole point of “not talking politics or religion” was that there should be, essentially, neutral ground where those sorts of divisive topics were avoided and people could focus on what they had in common in situations. Like dinner parties and sporting events. 

However, that peace was broken completely a while ago now. And so half the country is ineffectively trying to push the old order while the other half doesn’t understand why it was ever in place while lamenting all the division"

Who could that one good politician be? ;)
"I'm confused.  Now ""man"" and ""woman"" exist?"
"These fucking leftists try to tout that women can do anything a man can do. 

Yet when she debates and loses to a man, it’s that he’s mansplaining and a sexist.

It’s fucking retarded"
"Lol the left had no valid criticism of Pence, so they resorted to “a fly landed on his head” and “mansplaining”.

To be fair, Kamala is just as guilty of womansplaining as Mike was guilty of mansplaining. 

Kamala was off the rails, but my only criticism of Pence was that he frequently avoided answering some important questions (which they both did.)

However, I think the debate format is obsolete. Some topics and policies are too complex to cram into 30 seconds to a few minutes.

We need to change the format to long-form discussion. You give the runners ample time to make their points, it encourages reaching across the isle for collaboration and finding middle grounds, and the runners are actually going to have to know what they’re talking about or have their incompetence exposed."
"Who honestly gives a shit what other people do so long as they treat your family and you well, and leave you the fuck alone lest you need their help."
"If Republicans actually ran on this rhetoric, and implemented it in policy, and acted on their fiscal conservative rhetoric, I might be okay with the party."
Too bad GOP politicians don’t agree with this
"Democrat here, not posting this to start trouble I just wanted to let you all know that I respect your viewpoints and don’t automatically disagree with things you folks say just bc you’re Republicans!

Are we really at the point as a country where we are all either “blue staters” or “red staters” rather than us all being Americans?

"[Unemployment fell 16 points under Obama, 2.3 under Trump](https://apnews.com/f78f4205f474482db8bb8fa7a5ebfa27)

""The most dramatic drop in black unemployment came under Obama, when it fell from a recession high of 16.8 percent in March 2010 to 7.8 percent in January 2017""

Last year, under Trump, at the lowest point, black unemployment was at 5.5%

That means it dropped 16% under Obama,and 2.3% under Trump.

[However, black unemployment is currently at 16.8%](https://www.allpoliticsnow.com/black-unemployment/article\_eaf5d654-a99a-11ea-9ece-3b4b79167eb6.html)

I thought since Trump didn’t denounce white supremacy that it was bad leadership for the country and it would influence his followers /s
I decided to commit Reddit suicide. I posted to our favourite left wing subreddit
It’s (D)ifferent.
"Democrat hypocrisy has no bounds. It’s time that we just call Democrats racists, anti-semites, sexists, etc. pretty much all the time regardless of if it’s true or not since that’s what they do."
How the turn tables.
"Just answer me this, what is the problem with having a Voter ID? 

Besides the fact that you can’t cheat. Personally, I think that is a positive. What I don’t understand is how everyone isn’t on the same page about that? Please help me out here. I am serious."
"You wanna destroy some private shit, make it the private shit of your “allies”."
"It’s like commanding an army. If you want something gone, just put a trump sticker on it"
I appreciate the irony of using the Lisa Simpson meme to make this point.
"Are people fairly averse to talking about what our tax dollars do for us?I pay a metric ton in federal/state taxes and I know there is quite a few of us in this country doing the same.

In 2009, a strategy culminated as expected, with the fed (the taxpayer), bailing out a significant portion of industry to help the economy recover. From what I have read, this was not necessarily a mistake, it was a strategy based on the understanding that a government will act in the interest of stability and growth and help you, even if you are the party sabotaging this interest.

It almost seems like it is taboo to scrutinize this injustice. Meanwhile, many in the financial sector build their wealth and manage their risk around manipulating the existence of an entity known as a government.  


I would like to see both sides of the ile being more critical, refusing to forget."

You are not wrong.  We are last red states in the pacific north west. Don't know how long that will last with all these people moving here.
"I always think “I’ve been registered to vote since I was 18, and if you knew who I was voting for you wouldn’t want me to be registered anyway”"
"This is exactly what I feel every damn time they shove this ""MaKe sUrE yOuR rEgIsTerEd To VoTe"" crap down my throat on IG. Like, enough! I've been registered to vote for over a year now when I turned 18 and got my state ID."
"Every time i see that vote for your life ad I think to myself 'okay, I'll vote for Trump for my life'."
Oh no a man in his 70s doesn't get around perfectly all the time. Better elect the older senile candidate he should be in much better shape.
I just remember how much they tried to cover up and pretend it was not a problem that Clinton fell and having to be carried into a van.
"Andrew Yang was the only Democrat that had a clue when it comes to the media: 

>“If you turn on cable network news today, you would think he’s president because of some combination of Russia, racism, Facebook, Hillary Clinton, and emails all mixed together. But Americans around the country know different,” Yang argued. “ . . . The more we act like Donald Trump is the cause of all of our problems, we lose trust that we can actually see what is going on in our communities and solve those problems.”

CNN and MSNBC have been on some “did you see him drink water? >:)” bs for years. Honestly at this point they’re just giving us free real estate in the election."
America is the only country on earth that gets shit on for wanting to protect its own interests and culture.  Pure madness.
Stop!  Enough with the common sense already.  That has no place in today’s society! /s

"To be fair, I don't think Bernie is corrupt. He just genuinely believes in having the power to control who gets money and how much they deserve. 

He calls it fair. I call it elitism. But, you know... whatever."
It is always about her.  She hates this country and she hates us.  But she wants to enjoy the monetary support and privilege this country provides.
Check out her Twitter! She a racist POS!
"But she made BLM and Stacey Abrams happy…cementing her place in activism and athletic mediocrity, like Kaepernick. Now she will rot in irrelevance."
"....., and she wants to enjoy the monetary support and privilege this country provides...."
They are outright lying because they all complained about Trump wanting to help stop the violence but the idiot mayors say no. Sorry we all know you’re back tracking!!!’
WTF
"In SOME states it's illegal to take a picture of your ballot.

https://www.businessinsider.com/can-i-post-photo-of-my-ballot-selfie-polling-place-2020-10

It's not illegal in Virginia.  So before you try to berate OP...know that.

It is not ""personal and confidential information"" when OP posted it himself."
Congrats big dawg. I wish I hadn’t waited until I was 34. It’s embarrassing! You’re making us proud
Nice.
Thank you for taking your civic duty seriously.

Who?  Who is this post targeted harassment at?  Murderers?  Well, screw their feelings."
I can’t believe leftists think that white college students represent the black community better than these people’s family members.
Don’t forget about the black children who have been killed by BLM rioters. No I won’t call it protest it’s riots.
"I went outside to take trash out to the bin, and the guy that lives below me was outside crying on the steps. I sat next to him to see what was going on and he said his cousin was killed in one of the riots. She’s a black woman. Very sad"
Dying platform F FB

"He removed your post too probably because he was getting downvoted while you were getting upvotes, so the mod is probably 14 years old"
These people need to watch/listen to Thomas Sowell. Brilliant guy.
There's actually been mask and lock down protests literally all over the world. The popular part of reddit is nothing but anti America... don't listen.
">if we lose the pubs we lose the soul of England

Well he ain't wrong"
The protests have been ongoing for weeks and zero news media coverage...of course if a BLM guys farts it's National News!
I’m sure don jr engages in some fun as well lol
"Hunter's mom died in a car crash, and his brother died of cancer. Politics aside, that's enough to push a person to turning to substance use. The people ripping on him for turning to drugs are the same people that have never experienced either their own substance problems or had friends/family that have struggled with substances. If you had, you would know how difficult it is too dig your way out of that hole once you're in it. People have their flaws."
Nepotism shouldn't be in a modern democracy. End of discussion.
99% of Reddit think Fauci is a god
"What where the emails? I have never heard of them.
Edit: I’m not being critical, I just don’t watch the news much"
"When the punk movement is against you, you are the establishment.  Sleepy Joe had 45 years to do something positive in a political sphere, he literally brought nothing."
Wall Street is pretty split. I'd say most are pro Trump. They remember the booming 2019 economy.

Ridiculous. There's always an agenda.
"> The annual “Tribute in Light” display requires a large crew to pull off, the 9/11 Memorial and Museum said on its website, posing health risks this year that “were far too great.”

Sounds like it was the Museum's decision, not the city.

> The new plan, dubbed the “Tribute in Lights,” will feature buildings across the city lighting up their facades and spires in blue on 9/11.
“Many iconic New York City buildings will be lighting their spires and facades in blue to honor those killed on 9/11.”

And they're still having lights, just different ones."
"And this current president has all three branches of government and is having trouble coming up with $1.

Edit:  I am aware of three branches.  This was a dig at the judicial branch because I believe it's also filled with leftist.  SCOTUS has not been acting very conservative either but I'm not surprised by that.  They are lawyers."
It was congress who both did that and denied that. But okay ✅

No one is more surprised Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris as his VP than Joe Biden.
Biden’s shortlist was all black women. I don’t understand how someone using black females as political tokens is at ALL appealing to the black community.
What the fuck is wrong with these people?
Man they're the first ones to cry racism but they're the racist ones.
God I hope these people with these crazy ideas die out in the next few generations
They will push good people to become bigiots and racists.

Imagine having huge crime problems in blue cities and then defunding the police because you can’t think ahead past 5 minutes and what makes you feel good.
Forgot blame Trump after he has been offering assistance to Democrat ran hell holes for weeks!
"I find amusing ironic when blm and and antifa go from chanting ""down with police"" to ""call the police"" in the numerous videos posted on reddit."
"They burn down buildings, destroy businesses, ruin people’s lives and get away with it. The mayors and governors won’t do anything about it because it’s “peaceful protesting”.  One day, they will have to answer for their crimes, wether in this life or the next, and the same goes to those Antifa and BLM thugs."
Wrongful termination by definition.
"First, I know nothing about the actual details of this story, but having worked in education, there is a regular stream of stories where teacher X is fired for Y reason, and the reason Y is provided by the fired teacher, and is NOT the reason why the teacher was fired, but the district can't say why - because it is against the law. I have seen a few of these - where a teacher is fired and they make a splash because they run around and tell everyone they were fired because of some reason.

A school district wont say a teacher was fired because they were showing up drunk, hit a kid, ... etc. 

So I am always cautious about these types of stories."
"This is why you keep your personal Facebook page private posts only, nothing public. Also NEVER link your job on your Facebook profile. You never know where liberals might be hiding in the cracks in the walls like roaches ready to jump out.
I never mix work with personal stuff. I don’t friend co-workers either. I’ve seen various jobs I’ve been at use a personal Facebook profile against a person because a co worker showed it to a fellow manager. After that, I deleted my LinkedIn. Being a conservative you need to be careful these days."

Why are they destroying a CNN building? Like what was the logic behind targeting CNN??
Love the irony
"In Puerto Rico we need to present proof of US citizenship to register to vote, after that they issued you an electoral ID.  You need present that ID to vote. Of course, that ID is free."
Having an ID to get a gun should be racist too now since it infringes on the 2nd amendment
I’m so over the racists card. It means absolutely nothing now cuz it’s used for everything. Even white supremacy has lost its meaning. If every white person is a white supremacist then it means nothing. Like saying american. God forbid people show who they are when they vote.

"/r/Republican is a partisan subreddit.  This is a place for Republicans to discuss issues with other Republicans.
