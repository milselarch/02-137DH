Three reports on THIS submission.  All bogus.  

On THIS submission.

[So folks...there is me contacting the admins to let them know that y'all are trying to waste moderator time by filing bogus reports on a submission calling for harmony.](https://imgur.com/a/daYB1Wc)

Also, I'm seeing a lot of handwringing by the left here that everyone's not just saying, ""Yes"" to this post and some are expressing frustration with trying to deal with the left.

So...on this my cakeday...have a sampling of some of the comments you DID not see on this post...

And don't forget to thank your mods!!!

I believe the elites actually enjoy putting dems and reps against each other by pushing the divide and conquer agenda. After all, it's so easy to control the masses when we are constantly fighting against each other.

Like you say, 95% of dems and reps, and I can safely say it's the same anywhere else in the world, want the same things: safety, food, a job, to be happy. People don't naturally hate each other, we are programmed by the media to hate each other, to blame each other for their own problems.

So no, not all the dems are bad people. Your post proves that. If we finally learned to spread love we would finally understand that ""you must love one another"" is not just a nice biblical saying, it's the key for a better, happy society."

The main stream media wants to paint us all as racists, bigots, and deplorables. Why do you think we don't care when the media calls trump these things. We don't believe it because we heard them say the same things about Romney, Bush, McCain, somehow Ted Cruz even though he's Cuban.

If the past few days have taught us anything, it's that we have to make the voting process bullet-proof. There were probably Democratic candidates you liked over the years and voted for, but saw their opponent win, despite your guy's overwhelming popularity. There's a probability that your guy got cheated out of his chance to serve because of fraudulent votes. I know a guy who was in politics here in NY and had to leave after one year. He said the whole game is so dirty, everyone was on the take while the head guy turned a blind eye. You have to admit, their continuous stonewalling and miraculous vote finding at the last minute looks really suspicious. I have no doubt Trump will overcome this because he saw it coming a mile away.

I wasn‚Äôt always a trump supporter. But when I looked into the policies I got really stoked about how helpful it was.

I can‚Äôt say I know exactly what the democrats intentions are regarding their policies, but it really seems like they are trying so hard to give hand outs in hopes that there will be one party that rules everything.

We are reaching a breaking point with our debt, and I don‚Äôt know if our country can stand it. Greece fell apart once their debt reached 120% GDP, last year we were well over 105%. 

I don‚Äôt think they really care, they feed off the polarization, as well as pretending to be on the side of immigrants and young people voting and getting free assistance to protect their vote.

Donald Trump has been criticized by the media for the last 4 years over everything, and has gotten no respect while quietly putting together a good presidency.

Folks..."
https://i.redd.it/r66z1pkpzve51.jpg,i39vxx,I *would* be caught dead at a BLM rally with a MAGA hat on.
https://i.redd.it/r66z1pkpzve51.jpg,i39vxx,"Wearing a MAGA cap gets you de facto castigated as a person who is worth abusing. People in the MSM won't outright condone it.. In fact, they'll say they don't condone it but (big ol' BUT) they **understand** why people feel and act that way (right back to condoning it). 

This is why that Catholic school kid is getting all these settlements in libel lawsuits. He was viciously misrepresented on a national stage for the grand crime of wearing a MAGA hat, standing still, and smiling in a public setting."
https://i.redd.it/r66z1pkpzve51.jpg,i39vxx,It ain‚Äôt wrong you know.
https://i.redd.it/r66z1pkpzve51.jpg,i39vxx,"As a black female... I‚Äôm just glad that we‚Äôre all aware of this. Please don‚Äôt go to a BLM Rally with any MAGA stuff on trying to prove a point, it isn‚Äôt worth it and the BLM assholes will kill you for it 100%. Ugh."
https://i.redd.it/r66z1pkpzve51.jpg,i39vxx,Absolutely true! I think the people at the maga rally would be annoyed maybe but you‚Äôd get straight up murdered at the blm rally.
https://i.redd.it/r66z1pkpzve51.jpg,i39vxx,To be fair almost anywhere is safer the a BLM riot....i mean rally.

https://i.redd.it/r66z1pkpzve51.jpg,i39vxx,I think we‚Äôve already seen an example early on of a MAGA hat guy getting beaten to near-death by a BLM mob.
https://i.redd.it/r66z1pkpzve51.jpg,i39vxx,You mean that wearing a BLM shirt in a MAGA rally is safer than just living near a BLM rally
https://i.redd.it/r66z1pkpzve51.jpg,i39vxx,It's true because MAGA rallies are generally peaceful while BLM rallies are very often violent
https://i.redd.it/r66z1pkpzve51.jpg,i39vxx,The people of tolerance and woke-ness are really a bunch of brutal criminals if you don't agree with them.
https://i.redd.it/r66z1pkpzve51.jpg,i39vxx,Its not even close. You'd be FAR safe at a MAGA rally

I mean they were already pissed about me being conservative, but you know... being a trump supporter went to far for my ultra liberal former freinds"
https://i.redd.it/r66z1pkpzve51.jpg,i39vxx,Depends what state your in if you wear BLM in Arkansas you‚Äôre fucked
https://i.redd.it/r66z1pkpzve51.jpg,i39vxx,Well since BLM rallies seem to repel Covid-19 I guess I'll try it. Wish me luck

https://i.redd.it/r66z1pkpzve51.jpg,i39vxx,Yea cuz republicans aren‚Äôt big dicks
https://i.redd.it/r66z1pkpzve51.jpg,i39vxx,Perhaps the demographics of the two rallies has something to do with it?
https://i.redd.it/r66z1pkpzve51.jpg,i39vxx,A black kid at a white school is safer than a white kid at a black school.
https://i.redd.it/r66z1pkpzve51.jpg,i39vxx,"And this, kids, is why white privilege isn‚Äôt real"
https://i.redd.it/r66z1pkpzve51.jpg,i39vxx,"You‚Äôre going to get biased answers here simply because of the sub, similar if you went to /democrat and asked the same question.

https://i.redd.it/r66z1pkpzve51.jpg,i39vxx,Wow your safer at a event ran by the president with a hat people disagree with. An event with security vs protests that are not formally run with something they are directly protesting against. Wonder why

https://i.redd.it/c4d06ugnzmq51.png,j3qg7g,That was very nice of her
https://i.redd.it/c4d06ugnzmq51.png,j3qg7g,Classy and decent but they will have her head.
https://i.redd.it/c4d06ugnzmq51.png,j3qg7g,One of the few promising Democrats left in the party. The Dems could've a better chance by nominating her but NOPE.
https://i.redd.it/c4d06ugnzmq51.png,j3qg7g,I'm actually surprised.
https://i.redd.it/c4d06ugnzmq51.png,j3qg7g,Make democrats sane again Tulsi!
https://i.redd.it/c4d06ugnzmq51.png,j3qg7g,I wish more members of her party had morals

https://i.redd.it/c4d06ugnzmq51.png,j3qg7g,Tulsi is what a common democrat looked like in the late nineties and early 2000‚Äôs. Sad that people like her are a rarity now. Respect.
https://i.redd.it/c4d06ugnzmq51.png,j3qg7g,She is the only democrat that was on the debate stage I had any respect for.
https://i.redd.it/c4d06ugnzmq51.png,j3qg7g,I think tulsi is one of the only Democrat‚Äôs that could maybe make me want to switch sides.
https://i.redd.it/c4d06ugnzmq51.png,j3qg7g,If they‚Äôd nominated her instead of sleepy joe she probably wins tbh. But instead they went with an establishment  straight white male who‚Äôs been in power for over 45 years. What does that say about the party for women and minorities
https://i.redd.it/c4d06ugnzmq51.png,j3qg7g,Tulsi has class

https://i.redd.it/c4d06ugnzmq51.png,j3qg7g,Tulsi Gabbard is good people. And that's about the best compliment I can give someone.
https://i.redd.it/c4d06ugnzmq51.png,j3qg7g,Tulsi rocks
https://i.redd.it/c4d06ugnzmq51.png,j3qg7g,One of the classiest politician in our times!
https://i.redd.it/c4d06ugnzmq51.png,j3qg7g,Mazie Hirono  could take a few pointers in class from Tulsi.
https://i.redd.it/c4d06ugnzmq51.png,j3qg7g,She was the only normal one of the dem stage.

https://i.redd.it/c4d06ugnzmq51.png,j3qg7g,She's one of the few good Democrats left. Who do you think will say something awful first? My frontrunners are DeBlassio or Pelosi.
https://i.redd.it/c4d06ugnzmq51.png,j3qg7g,Tulsi Gabbard is the voice of reason/decency in the Democratic party. Respect is right.
https://i.redd.it/c4d06ugnzmq51.png,j3qg7g,"Tulsi is the only Democrat in this cycle I would have even considered voting for.  I still likely would vote Trump, but it would have been a tougher decision.

I know everyone says that.  But it's true.  Dems probably would have won this election if they had run Tulsi.

Biden only appeals to those who were already going to ""vote blue no matter who"" and nobody else."
https://i.redd.it/c4d06ugnzmq51.png,j3qg7g,Tulsi has always seemed like one of the good ones

https://i.redd.it/c4d06ugnzmq51.png,j3qg7g,Trump is still a person. Politics have nothing to do with this. Everyone regardless of party lines should hope he makes it through.

https://i.redd.it/c4d06ugnzmq51.png,j3qg7g,Still can't believe how dumb the Dems were not to run her
https://i.redd.it/c4d06ugnzmq51.png,j3qg7g,I would sincerely vote for her
https://i.redd.it/c4d06ugnzmq51.png,j3qg7g,And shes a hot

She will end up either taking over the D party and changing it (like Trump did for Rs) or leaving the D party if they continue with their trajectory toward radical, unhinged insanity. Which is almost complete."
https://i.redd.it/c4d06ugnzmq51.png,j3qg7g,I like her. She destroyed Kamala so hard the left doesn't dare trot her around with Biden as much as they could have.
https://i.redd.it/c4d06ugnzmq51.png,j3qg7g,Class act. I‚Äôm glad Biden didn‚Äôt pick her as the VP!!

https://i.redd.it/c4d06ugnzmq51.png,j3qg7g,Is Tulsi a closet Republican? I thought she would have been a formidable opponent for Trump.

https://i.redd.it/e3t6zh75yr461.jpg,kbqvcb,"I actually enjoy talking about politics for precisely this reason: one way or another, you'll figure out quickly how reasonable the people you're talking to are. (Though I also just enjoy talking about politics.) And most of the time, things turn out much better than places like Reddit might suggest. 

Religion on the other hand can be a difficult topic to get into with people, especially in ordinary, casual conversation. Because to really understand religion or being religious, I think you need to think more abstractly about things you've already seen; simply being told information isn't likely to convince people of a given belief. Sometimes it's better to tell a story that isn't explicitly about religion. (Indeed, even the way many recoil from talking about religion is itself revealing about religion!

I have no problem with transgender people but I‚Äôm not going to put my preferred pronouns in my Instagram bio! I want inclusivity for all but the questions on the college surveys are almost tricking me to answer that I feel like I‚Äôm discriminated against for being x y or z.

While unemployment had come down the work participation rate hadn't moved, GDP should have been double what it was, and $600 Billion was still $600 billion too much.

I cannot find the creator whom I wish to credit (I posted this with a link to whoever I thought it was only to realize they were discrediting it as theirs). I apologize if you think I did. It was sent to me by a conservative friend who knows I blog about similar frustrations.

I posted it though as a conversation starter and a way to vent as an accurate depiction of what we, minority political conservatives, have to deal with.

The black community is not Monolithic, as the Left would have you believe - ironically denoting their own real racism. We are not suddenly not black when we profess conservative values.

I've had on my heart for sometime now the desire to get out and just be with other like minded folks of all races especially but any faith or sexual orientation, too. I want to do this publicly, just getting to know each other and doing it out in public for all to see. I want to let people know that we conservatives are out there, we are colorful, and we enjoy life and we can do it together. And maybe we could reach out to people in the communities where we meet up and talk about conservative values together, but mostly just to be out together, getting to know one another. I mean it feels strangely racist to specifically seek out people of color, but at the same time the point is not our colors, it is to come together around shared values, to network, and to enjoy life.

Now, I must be honest, I have black friends but not many, nor many Hispanic friends, and none of them are very close. So I don't know how to broach this kind of topic. Most of the people of color I know are high school friends I haven't spoken with in years. But I would love to start some kind of meet up for conservatives of all types to come together in various localities just to go and hang out at a beach together, have a little cook out, things like that. I really just want to be friends, I need more conservative friends anyway. I don't give a shit about anyone's race, I never have, I just never made many friends who weren't white. And while I don't want to make friends just because someone is black or Hispanic or Asian or whatever, I think this country needs it and we conservatives just generally need to come out of the woodwork more and be seen in more liberal places.

He marked me as a capitalist pig, saying that every revolution is always paid in blood. That society can always be rebuilt from the ash, then he began to use my religion against me by saying Jesus wouldn‚Äôt do this etc (I said that Jesus is also against harming lives and thievery.)

He finally got tired of me and revealed that he‚Äôs been cheating behind my back, saying that his close friend makes a better boyfriend and lover in bed. He blocked me on everything afterwards and deleted the chat off telegram before I can screenshot it.

https://i.redd.it/p7isxqkq4xs51.png,jal8br,Leftists are the ones always screaming that men should have no say in abortion because they're not women. But they think that they as non gun owners should have a say in gun laws. Pick a train of thought and stick to it.
https://i.redd.it/p7isxqkq4xs51.png,jal8br,Not a republican. Definitely can‚Äôt deny this is a valid point. Owning a gun doesn‚Äôt mean she‚Äôs biased. Smh.
https://i.redd.it/p7isxqkq4xs51.png,jal8br,"If Amy didn't own a gun, could she fairly rule against people who owned guns? What a dumb article."

https://i.redd.it/p7isxqkq4xs51.png,jal8br,"The irony is CNN doesn‚Äôt even consider the opposite of what they are implying. If she *doesn‚Äôt* own a gun, would that make her judgment of gun rulings fair? 

It goes both ways if they want to contrive bias."
https://i.redd.it/p7isxqkq4xs51.png,jal8br,"If someone doesn‚Äôt own a gun, could they fairly judge a case on gun rights?"
https://i.redd.it/p7isxqkq4xs51.png,jal8br,Imagine thinking that exercising a right makes you unable to properly interpret it
https://i.redd.it/p7isxqkq4xs51.png,jal8br,She should take it outside and fire 2 blasts.

https://i.redd.it/p7isxqkq4xs51.png,jal8br,And she could.   She does not make laws she endorse those laws by judicial and executive branches.
https://i.redd.it/p7isxqkq4xs51.png,jal8br,So if you don‚Äôt own a gun could you fairly judge a case on guns?
https://i.redd.it/p7isxqkq4xs51.png,jal8br,"People who don't own a gun, or are ignorant on the topic of guns, should not be making legislation regarding guns, as such legislation would come from a place of ignorance.

CNN has it backwards."
https://i.redd.it/p7isxqkq4xs51.png,jal8br,She owns a vagina but she says she could fairly judge a rape case
https://i.redd.it/p7isxqkq4xs51.png,jal8br,Couldn't you make the same case if she didn't own a gun?
https://i.redd.it/p7isxqkq4xs51.png,jal8br,"If anything, NOT owning a gun would make you judge unfairly because it means you wouldn‚Äôt know anything about obtaining or using a gun"

On another note, I hope RBG had a better life than to actually have trump owning her on the way out. I hope she was with family reflecting on a hopefully good life."

If you stayed 6ft apart from people and washed your hands like we‚Äôve been taught our whole lives in school and work, I guarantee you it‚Äôs a better defense against viruses sicknesses then just wearing a mask. 

I wish everyone just chilled on the mask for gods sake. It is affective and I am not denying that. I wear it no problem. But it‚Äôs like everyone thinks wearing a mask will stop the virus 100%... but then  touching that surface and then itching your ear (even with the mask on) can still give you covid.

Ideally everyone would do all 3, frequent hand washing, social distancing, and masks. Its just that enforcing most of those is not really possible except for masks as they're easily visible. Also what happens if someone refuses? I see signs on most stores saying masks required, yet it seems like the stores can't really enforce it themselves, so a handful of people will ignore it.

Shouldn't he be talking about how South LA's city council, mayor, etc. have failed the city?

In other words, what did MW have to do with what he's talking about?"

It may have lead more people to support him right then and there... Now to get behind him the audience has to try to dig up his policies. I'm afraid that most voters in that district won't do that and just end up supporting whoever the democratic candidate is...

https://i.redd.it/lgeo4kp1fh461.jpg,kav9xs,"Modern western socialists are incapable of reconciling their two contradictory positions, that they're humanitarians who value you human rights, and that they support socialism as a solution to our problems. 

It's absolutely incredible how extreme the feats of mental gymnastics are by liberals who defend socialism. They're incapable of accepting that there are countless examples of their ideology, being pursued without opposition, absolutely destroying human freedom and prosperity.

A left-wing person, who will pretend to be pro Latino, pro human rights, and against authoritarianism, will, without even a shred of awareness, suggest that all the Venezuelans who are against the socialism that destroyed their society just have it wrong. 

Also it's hilarious to remember the standard reddit discourse about Venezuela and Hugo Chavez just years ago. Oblivious western liberals were universally heralding Chavez's Venezuela as an incredible accomplishment and a clear rebuttal to conservatives' warnings about the inherent brutality and economic disaster that results from socialism. Now, those very people who paid lip service to Venezuela and Chavez will either immediately say ""it's not socialism's fault, it's authoritarianism"" and suggest that it can be done right next time, or they will refuse to admit that anything wrong has happened in Venezuela except for American sabotage.

Socialists are psychotic, inherently dishonest, embryonic Stalins whose entire ideology is rooted in a desire to control other people on one hand, basic sadism, and or a mindless, feeble desire to have decisions and work of their lives handed over to government benefactors.

People who support socialism are either psychopaths or boot-licking supplicants. Both types are incapable of accepting any facts that highlight the inherent, inescapable catastrophes that their ideology has wrought on the world.

A left wing socialist in the US will, without even a shred of logic, tell a Venezuelan who has first hand experience of the failed socialist experiment in Venezuela, that it was not ""real socialism"" or that it actually ""isn't that bad""."

She lives in Florida and would've been delighted to vote for Trump if she would've made the cutoff in time. Here's hoping she's around for the next presidential elections!

https://i.redd.it/g2jwk1rgvw351.jpg,gzqhfo,"[Unemployment fell 16 points under Obama, 2.3 under Trump](https://apnews.com/f78f4205f474482db8bb8fa7a5ebfa27)

""The most dramatic drop in black unemployment came under Obama, when it fell from a recession high of 16.8 percent in March 2010 to 7.8 percent in January 2017""

Last year, under Trump, at the lowest point, black unemployment was at 5.5%

That means it dropped 16% under Obama,and 2.3% under Trump.

[However, black unemployment is currently at 16.8%](https://www.allpoliticsnow.com/black-unemployment/article\_eaf5d654-a99a-11ea-9ece-3b4b79167eb6.html)

Ironically, black unemployment is back where it was before Obama took office."

https://i.redd.it/g2jwk1rgvw351.jpg,gzqhfo,First Bill helps open the airways for drugs and guns in Mena and then he puts his customers in jail after he becomes president so he can say he lowered crime. That is one hell of a business model!

https://i.redd.it/g2jwk1rgvw351.jpg,gzqhfo,"Terrible example to blast Obama on this. He inherited the housing bubble crash which was set up by the poor management and economic policy surrounding banks in the 2000s. This is why you see record black unemployment between 2009 and 2011. His economic policy clearly at least allowed a steady trend of black and white males back to work and then when trump took over, he continued that trend and brought unemployment to close to lows we haven‚Äôt seen since 2000 (and 1970 before that). 

Then corona happened and now unemployment is at record highs.. but hopefully with this sharp increase we can see a sharp decrease because we really haven‚Äôt seen how an economy recovers in recent times from a pandemic, especially with how many people will hopefully be returning to work"

The president was widely (and mistakenly) praised for his first unconstitutional strike against Syria. Still, it obviously didn‚Äôt deter future chemical use, nor did it slow Assad‚Äôs advance against Syrian rebels. Dictators are used to taking losses. They don‚Äôt care about their people, and they can replace lost equipment. Besides, Assad‚Äôs true military power lies in his alliances with Russia and Iran.

So, Trump did the same thing. Did any of you complain? Also, a difference between Biden's attack and Trump's attack was that Syria attacked our own. I have to say that it is approved for it to occur. It wouldn't matter if Trump were president during that event. If the country is going to kill one of our own, then expect retaliation. 

If we want to talk about hypocrites, we start by talking about how the right-wing is so much for amendments, but only if it matches their narratives. 

A quick read between the two events, and I found significant differences. A retaliation against our own and the other was basically for weapons or usage of chemical warfare. 

Biden is paying for that incident, as Trump did for his first strike in 2017 against Syria."

https://i.redd.it/wou88lwkgwq51.jpg,j4h3rq,"Politicians are the only people in the world who create problems and then campaign against them.¬†

Have you ever wondered why, if both the Democrats and the Republicans are against deficits, WHY we have deficits? 

Have you ever wondered why, if all the politicians are against inflation and high taxes, WHY do we have inflation and high taxes? 

We the people do not propose a federal budget. The president does.¬†

We the People do not have the Constitutional authority to vote on appropriations. The House of Representatives does. We the People don't write the tax code, Congress does. We the People don't set fiscal policy, Congress does. 

We the People don't control monetary policy, the Federal Reserve Bank does. 

100 Senators, 435 Congressmen, 1 President, 9 Supreme Court justices - 545 human beings. Out of the 350 million legal citizens, 50 million illegals, the politicians are directly, legally, morally, and individually responsible for the domestic problems that plague this country. 

I excluded the members of the Federal Reserve Board because that problem was created by the Congress. In 1913, Congress delegated its Constitutional duty to provide a sound currency to a federally chartered, but private, Central Bank. 

I exclude all the special interests and lobbyists for a reason. They have no legal authority. They have no ability to coerce a senator, a congressman, or a president to do one stinking thing. I don't care if they offer a politician $1 million dollars in cash. The politician has the power to accept or reject it. No matter what the lobbyist promises, it is the legislator's responsibility to determine how he votes. 

These 545 human beings spend much of their energy convincing you that what they did is not their fault. They cooperate in this huge con regardless of party. What separates a politician from a normal human being is an excessive amount of gall. No normal human being would have the gall of a Speaker, who stood up and criticized the President for creating deficits. The president can only propose a budget. He cannot force the Congress to accept it. 

The Constitution, which is the supreme law of the land, gives sole responsibility to the House of Representatives for originating and approving appropriations and taxes. Nancy Pelosi is the speaker of the House. She is the leader of the majority party. She and fellow House members, not the president, can approve any budget they want. If the president vetoes it, they can pass it over his veto if they agree to. 

What is inconceivable to me is that a nation of 350 million cannot replace 545 people who stand convicted -- by present facts -- of incompetence and irresponsibility. I can't think of a single domestic problem that is not traceable directly to those 545 people. When you fully grasp the plain truth that 545 people exercise the power of the federal government, then it must follow that what exists is what they want to exist. 

If the tax code is unfair, it's because they want it unfair.¬† If the budget is in the red, it's because they want it in the red. 

If the Military is in IRAQ and Afghanistan, it's because they want them there.¬† If they do not receive social security but are on an elite retirement plan not available to the people, it's because they want it that way. 

There are no insoluble government problems.¬† Do not let these 545 people shift the blame to bureaucrats, whom they hire and whose jobs they can abolish or to lobbyists, whose gifts and advice they can reject or to regulators, to whom they give the power to regulate and from whom they can take this power. Above all, do not let them con you into the belief that there exists disembodied mystical forces like ""the economy,"" ""inflation,"" or ""politics"" that prevent them from doing what they take an oath to do. Those 545 people and they alone, are responsible. They and they alone, have the power. They and they alone, should be held accountable by the people who are their bosses -provided the voters have the gumption to manage their own employees. 

We should vote all of them out of office and clean up their mess! 
Sorry so long"

https://i.redd.it/wou88lwkgwq51.jpg,j4h3rq,"(serious) 

Guys, I'm European and I am not into being horrible about others. I can only tell you about my point of view and that of those around me. It does not mean everyone thinks the same as me, but I can tell you that I do seem to be part of a majority where I come from regarding our views of America.

I don't know many people who think America is the devil, or that all Americans are this or that. However, most people I know feel worried, bemused, shocked, pity and yes, a hint of schadenfreude regarding the USA.

I know it will be very hard to believe as most of you clearly think otherwise, but to many of us, what is happening in your country (it being a developed democracy and not an authoritarian regime) is truly unfathomable. The attitudes, speech and actions of your government are concerning to say the least.

But its not just that. In European democracies (note the focus there, we have problematic regimes too), you'll find it very hard to find a country where things are politicised in the way they seem to be there. From an outside point of view, it's difficult to understand. Masks for example, there are definitely debates here too (although most people would agree that right now is not the time to go against the medical consensus, most people does agree that there will have to be long and thorough studies about this situation after it is under control). However, this is not right /left matter at all. Both sides seem to genuinely hate each other there. 

Then its the matter of the type of right /left in the country. I lived in England for a long time which I thought (perhaps wrongfully) that it would be the closest European country to the USA. Our (mainstream) right wing is so so so left of yours that it's difficult to conceptualise in some matters. And they are really not particularly left wing from our point of view. Really, no-one would ever say the tory party is left wing in a million years, and yet they are in some policies closer to your Democrats. 

In any case, all this to say, I get it, it might seem that we don't get you. But that's because, even though in some aspects we are similar, we really don't get you. Our mainstream (again, the word mainstream is important) cultures are so completely different in that regard. Its not a conspiracy theory or the soyboy brigade, it's genuine differences. 

I'm sure I will get a barrage of down votes or be ignored completely. I just wanted to give you an honest point of view from the other side of the ocean"

There are a lot of people who are unhappy with their lives.  Instead of looking at themselves and working hard to improve themselves and their lives they just want a quick fix.

He has a plan, it is published on the web for all to see.  But when the previous administration did absolutely nothing to curtail covid since November, what do you expect?  What might have worked given statistical modeling in November is most likely no longer the case in January."

Joe Biden has repeatedly said he was arrested with Nelson Mandela on the streets of Soweto during a trip to South Africa in the 1970s, when South Africa was under apartheid.  (Had to admit was untrue)

Biden said on May 22, 2020 in an interview on The Breakfast Club radio show: ‚ÄúThe NAACP has endorsed me every time I've run.‚Äù 

In a famous video confrontation with a critic, Joe Biden shouted: ""I went to law school on a full academic scholarship, the only one in my class who had a full academic scholarship. The first year in law school, I decided I didn‚Äôt want to be in law school and ended up in the bottom two-thirds of my class. And then decided I wanted to stay, went back to law school and, in fact, ended up in the top half of my class.

2. I ran because of what Trump said in Charlottesville, proving he‚Äôs a racist and supports white supremacy.  Meanwhile, Snopes and other fact checking organizations have found those statements to be false.

https://i.redd.it/x1i6py9k2rh61.jpg,lkth2z,You have to sign a petition for the recall. I‚Äôm confused what his point is. There‚Äôs no set time for a recall vote until you get enough people to sign a petition saying they want a recall.

I wasn‚Äôt planning on signing the recall petition but now I am. Fuck that!"
https://i.redd.it/x1i6py9k2rh61.jpg,lkth2z,California uses a random sample of signatures instead of verifying every last signature. Then applies the invalid sample rate to the total count. So if they found that 600 of 800 were valid then they apply the same percentage to the raw total count.  In the case of a petition it could reduce the total number of signatures counted toward the measure but in the case of an election because it's random it is extremely unlikely to change the direction of the vote.

In 2009, a strategy culminated as expected, with the fed (the taxpayer), bailing out a significant portion of industry to help the economy recover. From what I have read, this was not necessarily a mistake, it was a strategy based on the understanding that a government will act in the interest of stability and growth and help you, even if you are the party sabotaging this interest.

It almost seems like it is taboo to scrutinize this injustice. Meanwhile, many in the financial sector build their wealth and manage their risk around manipulating the existence of an entity known as a government.

This absolutely spectacular bit of hypocrisy is surreal to even those who never had any faith in our politics or our media. 

This is how we know that the left is a complete joke. Every single thing they say, every single narrative they enforce, is a gigantic load of bullshit. Every single thing is political with them. Everything. They will never fail to have double-standards and hypocrisy as the bedrock of their entire perception of the world.

I have seen a few of these - where a teacher is fired and they make a splash because they run around and tell everyone they were fired because of some reason.

A school district wont say a teacher was fired because they were showing up drunk, hit a kid, ... etc. 

So I am always cautious about these types of stories."

My guess is it was the Corona virus conspiracy theory memes. Apparently it was a parent that called into the school that got her fired. Freedom of speech is an interesting thing when it comes to job security. A private company isn't telling you what you can or can't say if they fire you over some memes. They're just telling you: because you said those things you aren't the kind of employee we want to have representing us, on or off the clock. 

HOWEVER, the first amendment does protect us from having the government tell us what we can and can't say. Her being a principal at a public school means that she is a government employee, and by her termination the government is in fact telling her what she can and can't say. This is a violation of her first amendment rights. Personally I don't think someone who thinks Corona virus is a conspiracy should be running a public school right now when the pandemic is getting pretty out of hand. I'm sure that the parent who got her fired feels the same way. But if she was doing her job, following infection control protocol at the school, and keeping the kids safe to the best of her ability, it doesn't matter whether she thinks Corona virus is a hoax or not. Period.

Voting is an inalienable right. Any natural citizen of this country reserves the right to vote, and you have to register to vote anyways, but not everyone has an ID or can get an ID. The ones most likely to not have ID'S tend to be people of color.

https://i.redd.it/iqm1orzepcu61.png,mutklo,"First of all calling it ""racist"" is a massive over simplification. Second it's not about the ID and it's never been about the ID. It's about intentionally excluding people, specifically young people and people of color.

For anyone unfamiliar with the process. On election day a registered voter gives a poll worker their name and address. The poll worker verifies that the person is in the registry for that polling place. The voter signs the registry affirming that they are the person in the registry, the poll worker signs as an official witness. The voter then received a ballot and can vote. 

The only type of vote fraud that voter ID has the capacity to stop is in person voter impersonation. And there has never been any proof that that type of fraud has ever been so problematic as to have effected the outcome of a single election. To say that it is ""uncommon"" is a massive understatement. 

Republican officials elected and otherwise have said on record that they win when it's harder to vote. They have said that voter impersonation does not happen.

Voting is the keystone to our republic and erecting barriers to the franchise serves only to keep power out of the hands of those who have already been excluded. 

Prove me wrong. Give me facts that in person voter fraud is so rampant that it justifies disenfranchising millions of eligible voters. OPINIONS DON'T COUNT, give me sources, arrests records, court proceedings, legal precedent. 

If you ban me or delete this comment you've only proven that I'm right.
