"I believe this should immediately make Hunter Biden ineligible for ever running for public office.  This works out well because he has never sought any public office and he has never mentioned his intentions to do so, so win/win I guess.

"The DNC caused this by pushing their own agenda instead of what the people wanted. It's the polar opposite of what the Republican Party was struggling with. They were trying to reign in what the people wanted to push their own agenda. All. I can say is FUCK YOU, DNC! YOU FAILED US!"

"Bernie would not have won either. America has spoken. The progressive movement does not have the support it thinks it does.

Dear op: go fuck yourself.  BernieBros caused this by being more interested in their own selfish hobby-horse than in promoting Democratic/Progressive values.
For the life of me I don’t understand why we all can’t get together on this. Anyone serving 30 or 40 years in Congress is owned.
Maybe we could all get together...go to the capitol. And air our grievances!!!
"Term limits will just raise the prices lobbyists will spend on the congress people. Term limits are undemocratic, this won't solve the issue.

We need campaign finance reform, political ad transparency, give the fec actual teeth to hold dirty candidates accountable, fix gerrymandering and expand voting rights and accessibility.

You want a red flag on term limits? Ted Cruz supports them.

What we also definitely need is a maximum age allowed into congress. The avg age in congress is double that of Americans"

Biden is the only officially /r/Democrat endorsed candidate
Got video? Because people have been ascribing all kinds of things to George Carlin since the nineties.
"Corruption is present in both parties but only called out on the GOP side because the media is so crazy biased.

The media is good at creating the vision of an evil GOP, but fails to reign in the Democratic Party to the DNC's own harm.

If the media did its job rather than acting as Crony Mouthpieces of the controlling interests then we'd have actual choice in voting. The fact is we have the same choice with either an (R) or a (D) but they're identical with the only differences being at the extremes, which sadly control both parties.

I'll get to vote in my state's primary later, but it's so late that I'm not sure it will even matter.

And, given the choice between incoherent Biden and Trump--I'll vote Trump. Most politicians are pretty smart but play dumb for their audience; Biden, to meet him in person, really is that dumb. As a Senator he was punching way above his weight class already. He's definitely NOT Presidential material.

When he says things like, ""We'll settle this out behind the shed."" he really means it because that's Joe Biden. He's just the neighborhood guy sitting at the end of the bar ready to prove his manhood in a feat of strength or a brawl to show he's the bigger man. Nobody told Joe that isn't really how the world works, and he's just a dolt who can't take a hint.

So, in the Dotard race for President, I'll take four more years of the current Administration over a senile and declining bar brawler.

What is it with the party of ""diversity"" racing to show that it can be more white, older, and more male than anyone else? Does anyone else find this disturbing?"
If you guys ran Yang I’d consider not voting Trump.
"Yes of course emails all the time 24/7 there is literally nothing else in the world going on. Trump isn't giving massive donations (oh sorry tax cuts) to the rich, dismantling the EPA, creating social chaos, taking bribes from foreign countries (oh sorry those are totally unrelated business deals), obstructing justice... Hold on this just in ""Trump shoots unarmed black woman in cold blood. Now Hannity with his top story on crooked Hillary and her missing email"""
Of course it's fucking weebs and neckbeards here.

"There is no ""one-size-fits-all"" in regards to minimum wage.  As a result, the minimum wage fight has been happening at the state and local level over the last 15 years.  7.25 might be OK as a minimum in Mississippi, but it damn sure isn't in CA or in any major city really."
"Well the reason not much has changed over the last 12 years is because inflation has made it not that necessary; for example if you took $3500 in 2009 it would be worth about $4500, now if you find the change in percent its about a 21.43% change. So at most it would only make sense to at most raise it to $8.80."

Hey that's great, but that's not what Ron Paul has on tap. The rest of the article is nothing but glowing praise for Ron Paul, sans citation.

If you sincerely know of and advocate Ron Paul's positions, then you were a fool if you voted for Obama in the past presidential election. It's great if you have since found something that more closely matches your views.

Fuck Biden for separating the democrats. Who in the right mind would vote for someone who says that marijuana is a ‘Gateway Drug’?

"Sanders - Calls himself a ""Social Democrat"". His platform would require such high taxation that it would resemble Communism. Result - Trump win.

Biden - Has serious issues with his habitual use of his position, to enrich his family and friends. Also has some serious gaff issues. Result - Trump win.

This tribal mindset is getting worse and worse each election and currently their drunk on their power spewing out their alternate reality babble.

I have so many words to write.. yet I'm speechless as everyday they cover the last with new drama.. And it's all planned!
Say what you want now and fire up the base with B.S because they dont fact check nor will they recall or care what was said because theirs a new mountain of lies on top of that.

They've become accustomed to being lied too but it works in their alternate reality, You cant show them charts, graphs or anything factual, They wont even look because it doesnt fit into their world of lies. How do you live your life not knowing the truth or facts? Can their minds not handle it? Is it too much.

Their being led by their party mimicking their church practices, Dont question what your being told. Dont believe your lying eyes! Gerrymandering.. voter suppression.. stealing elections!!

What has America become.. No one needs to invade you all your tearing yourselves apart. Luckily your a continent away from everyone else and you only have to worry about the corporate invasions on your wallets. 

Republicans rob and loot and then Democrats clean it up and keep it stable, Republicans get the economy going red hot and cause a crash and Democrats clean it up. 

My mind sees it's all pre planned, You know their making money off of these pre planned crashes. Then their bailed out and the middle class is decimated once again. 

I talk to Republicans who claim Obama caused the last housing crisis, He wasnt even in power!! He repaired it after Bush left!! The stupidity of these people to not research facts but it doesnt matter to them..

Where is all this leading?.. Is the point to get all Democrats and independents to throw their hands up in the air and quit and let Republicans control the military and bring about their end of the world scenario. 

You know that's what they think.. They spend like theirs no tomorrow yet whine when Democrats spend anything to further everyone. Who wants a stable world full of happy people. Jesus wont return in those conditions"

"I didn't vote for Trump, but I'm Canadian so...

I sit up here though, reading US opinions and watching this war go on. It seems to me, that Donald J Trump evokes such a negative emotional response from so many people, that it resembles some sort of spell.

I also see the base of the Republican Party basking in Trump's presidency. Wallowing in his unpolitical personality and his nationalistic policies. It amazes me that the religious right is able to stand behind this guy, who's left a trail of fairly unholiness in his wake throughout his life. But...follow they do. Why? Its actually incredibly simple. In fact I also think its the simplicity of Trump's base appeal, that produces such unbelievable frustration in Democrats.

MY NATION FIRST! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Democrats...the people want a rational and beneficial response to the blood-letting that Globalist policies have imposed on the American middle-class...and indeed the middle-class of the entire western world.

Ya know...were the Democratic Party able to find a candidate who can make American's their primary concern, and express that openly and proudly...you'd win.

Simple as that."
So all those people walked from south America since Biden was elected? That's making real good time. They must have been ready to go. So the premise seems unlikely. The Mexican President evidently let them into his country didn't he? Who else would he blame it on?
100% biden's fault on this
"I don't get how some people want to let in whoever comes knocking at our border, or sneaks in illegally. Makes absolutely no sense, nobody sees that circumventing a system put in place to protect a country and it's citizens (proper processes towards immigration and entry) sets a very bad precedent and enforces the idea that anybody and everybody is welcome even before we do our due diligence on you?
Not to mention financial strain on the economy."
I feel bad for the people of the world. But they need to pursue Legal means of migration. You can't just show up...to any country in the world...and expect citizenship.
Nobody said anything when this same thing happened in 2019. So this appears hypocritical. Only this time instead of leaving the children to the dangers of criminal forces the Biden administration is working to take care of them. To get them connected to their American relatives. The main point is that these are human beings like you and I and we should do everything we can to protect them. It doesn't make any sense to die in a foreign war to protect people but condemn them if they show up at the border. Or to fight abortion with religious arguments but condemn children at the border.

"I personally don’t see the big deal with him being a billionaire. It’s a problem with the system, not the candidate. He’s been a decent mayor other than the stop and frisk, and has great proposals for gun control and climate change, which I consider the two most important issues at the moment."
"TBH, I'm not threatened by the idea of making a boring billionaire with no personality disorders president.

I mean, I know I'm the dog in the ""this is fine"" meme, but frankly, Bloomberg is a very normal person. I mean, of course I don't like the stop and frisk stuff... but I think he is trying to make peace with that. It seems that he realizes his former republican self was a little too much.

Sure...its CNN's fault this president pulls a different stunt or lie every single day that needs to be fact checked and you want to blame the people trying to keep him honest.? What planet are you people from?
"You could say the same thing about Fox when Obama was President. While CNN does lean left, I think they give a fair voice to conservative view points, unlike Faux who has their hosts and commentator scream over the one or two liberals they allow on their shows. "
The news isn't made to inform you. It's made to get you to watch it for as long as possible. CNN thinks talking shit about Trump constantly is what its viewers want just like fox thinks praising trump for everything he does is what their viewers want. What I would do for a news source that does its best to inform in a way that is as unbiased as possible.
Because it's stupid and there's no legal basis for it

"Short answer: because I identify as a moderate Democrat and believe moderate policies are what America needs, and the only thing the GOP will let pass. 

Obviously his political career isn’t perfect. His biggest flaw was that he sided with the wrong side of history to score cheap political points in his early years, but that hasn’t been the case since he became nationally known. However Bernie’s biggest flaw is the lack of accomplishments. 

I 100% back Joe Biden and believe in him, and I truly hope you change your mind about voting 3rd party. If even half of Gary Johnson’s base from 2016 voted for Hillary, we wouldn’t be in this mess. I admire you for actually voting, but please realize a 3rd party vote is a vote for the person we’re trying to vote out."

With Biden no way. Do some self reflection on you centrists views, stop watching mainstream media, and get your info from online podcasts like young people do. The mainstream media brainwashed you into being centrists and you lost in 2016 because of it and will again in 2020. Wise up stop holding the country back!!!!"

Good. Federal policies shouldn’t be shaped by huge wide-open states with no people in them. They should reflect the will of the majority of voters. Those states still have the power to make their own laws within their own borders.
"This is a grossly inaccurate map for a popular vote, but actually pretty accurate for the electoral college. If you can get just over half of the votes (or not even, you just need the most) in Texas, NY, Florida and CA you've essentially won the EC. 

Those four states combined aren't even a quarter of our eligible voting population."
"Just because you have huge impact font doesn't mean you're clever.

PEOPLE vote NOT LAND. You republikkkans are so damn stupid."
