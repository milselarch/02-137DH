6,"""Moderate"" Democrats are just Republicans","If you're a Democrat and don't champion progressive ideals like Medicare for All, Tuition Free Schooling, $15 minimum wage and paid leave for new mothers than you're not really a Democrat.

13,"I wish the Democratic Party was actually interested in winning, instead we’re in for 4 more years of the same shit by the looks of it...","I will admit this is more just me yelling to myself and whoever might here me than coherent debate, as is what seems to be democratic tradition.

The party that always chooses whoever gets backed by the military industrial complex despite constantly preaching that we’re the “anti-war” party.

The party that claims the “diversity” party despite propping up the worst possible female candidates they could find to make the rich old dudes seem more relatable.

The party that still won’t shut the fuck up about Kamala Harris despite being out of the race for months and being the most useless sack of shit that can’t debate to save her own life.

The party that allows Mike Fucking Bloomberg a chance to speak about safety and privacy policy despite being the most authoritarian one in the entire race.

The party that talks down and belittles any and all underneath them even if you agree with them with the media. To them if you’re a democrat in their eyes you’re a weak little sheep that has to coddled and told what to think and how to act, if you’re not you’re a mindless slave to the trump administration or a nazi.

That party that eats away at its own party members for stepping out of line. Andrew Yang, Tulsi Gabbard, and Bernie Sanders are prime examples of this. They’d rather get destroyed by Trump by choosing Biden’s old jittering ass, than put up a fight with either of these three. Yang can’t win because he’s just too down to earth and believes in worker’s well-being. Tulsi can’t win because she actually wants out of the Middle East because she served there and cares way too much for Veterans. Sanders can’t win because he wants to expand health care among the middle and lower class. 

Oh but Biden isn’t Trump so he’s perfect! Sure his brain has to work overtime in order to comprehend more than a few sentences at a time and he’s basically just a show pony for the Obama years, but c’mon guys he isn’t the orange guy and that’s all we need!

Oh sweet jumping Jesus, the DNC. Never in my life have I seen a more corrupt, shit slinging organization in my life. The amount of times the DNC has been caught pushing favoritism or stealing votes from one candidate to another is on the level of dystopian nightmare, 1984 type of shit. It’s really no wonder so many people I know can’t even say they’re a Democrat or a Liberal with any pride anymore.

18,FFS when will Democrats actually use a democratic process to pick their candidate?,"As a non-American by birth I find the US political system completely bizarre, anachronistic, and just plain wrong.  From legalized corruption and bribery of campaign donations, toothless ethics committees, gerrymandering, electoral college, the two party system, need I go on?

But one thing that really strikes me, how is the supposed ""democratic"" party still using this antiquated caucus system and state by state primaries that I simply cannot fathom the modern day rationale of other than to help the DNC continue to manhandle the system to their advantage. Not to mention how it subjects us to the embarrassing and interminable never ending primary debate that after two or three is anyone really still paying attention except the opposition?

I'm no poly-sci student by WTF can't we:

1. Hold all primary votes on one day across the nation
2. Use ranked choice voting to let people vote their heart without fear of spoilers
3. Require candidates to actually be democrats (I'll let you decide what that means)
4. I have no 4 - insert your gripe of choice here

20,Jefferey Epstein Tested NEGATIVE for CoronaVirus | Because someone killed him on August 10th 2019!,"Jeffrey Epstein was a New York-based financier with high-profile ties to the world's ultra-wealthy and best friend to former President of The United States of America Bill Clinton who also ran Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign for President of The United States of America. Accused of sexually abusing many underage girls, Epstein was finally caught and charged for soliciting a minor for prostitution in Florida in 2008 and became a registered sex offender. Of his 18-month prison sentence, he served 13 months. In July 2019, Epstein was arrested again — this time on federal charges of sex-trafficking minors. While awaiting trial, he was found dead in his jail cell on August 10, 2019. The medical examiner concluded his death was by suicide, but a separate investigation prompted by Epstein's family suggests he may have been murdered.",fooo9r,23,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Democrat/comments/fooo9r/jefferey_epstein_tested_negative_for_coronavirus/

26,My take on the current state of America.,"I am not a democrat or a republican but if I had a penny for every disagreement the two parties had I would be the richest man alive. I am a member of a third party(Libertarian) and am sick of the dems and reps throwing the ball back and forth to systematically divide the country while they profit. a two-party system thrives off division. and ""the stakes"" get higher every election... George Washington said that political parties would destroy the country. Abraham Lincon said a house divided amongst itself cannot stand. 

&#x200B;

throw your hate. refuse to believe you can be wrong on anything. see where it leads. democracy is not perfect. but it is better than authoritarianism. it is better than a dictatorship. and it is better than a societal collapse. when we as a people are unwilling to compromise or admit to being wrong we risk the very heart of the nation. you see people lash out and try to kill government officials both Democrats and Republicans alike. you see people claim that someone who doesn't agree with them on everything as a false citizen. this type of attitude can, has, or will lead to the end of nations large and small. the united states is no different.

73,I am tired,"I think I should say that first and foremost I do not allign myself with any one party republican or democrat but I think I speak for many Americans when I say we are tired. Joe Biden is the 5th consecutive president to call attacks on the Middle East. Yes it may have been retaliation but for what. Why do we still have countless bases in the Middle East. Why must we be there in the first place? Why is our country a non-stop war machine? Why are all our soldiers overseas for US interests? Why is our biggest expense on our military and these countless bases that in all reality the majority of our nation will never see? Why do we stand on our own two feet but all our allies have to be crutched? 

Let's make a demand for isolation. 
Let's make a demand for these countless bases to be handed over to our allies. 
Let's end the war machine. 
Let's demand for it all to end. 
We can spend the money here. 
Our soldiers can be trained in things other than war and when not holding a rifle be trained in building up our infrastructure, our medics can be deployed within our borders at free clinics, our air force can fly around our borders instead of in some far off country. 

During the last 5 Presidents the world moved ahead of us. We may have iPhones but Asia has high speed railways, Japan has security robots, Dubai has autonomous drone taxis, Europe has the most advanced particle physics laboratory(CERN) , and the tallest building is no longer within the US.  We fell behind in all but war. 

The lie the government has been selling us is that it's for protection or that it's in our interests. But tell me if our homes are not overseas than who are we protecting? Isnt it more in our interests to spend our money not outside of our borders? Our country is falling to shambles and we are being placated like children by deals at Walmart for a 10 dollar wrench that cost a dollar to make. (Random example) 

We could easily have built the most effective anti-missile/anti-aircraft/anti-weapon defense system with zero flaws but instead we built the most devastating weapons we could create. In the end what are we trying to achieve? Why have we been fed the sob stories of the world and why do we continue to intervene? What benefit does it have to every household in America that a man in a cave with a gun on the other side of the world is dead. Instead of just making our country more secure here where it matters we worried ourselves with people who have no access to us because we let our guard down 20 years ago . They hit us here because we weren't secure over here not over there. 

Remember Isis? Do you remember why Isis came to power? They came to power because our war machine created hate. Do we need to continue to create our own enemies? End it all.",ltxnpe,12,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Democrat/comments/ltxnpe/i_am_tired/

91,"The Great LIE Of ""The Woke""","This will be my last post in this sub, which will make the ""The Woke"" tweenkies who bring their damaged psyches here to express their weakness and offense, very happy indeed.

I was handed a 7 day REDDIT ban for posting an OP piece, in which I expressed my pride in my liberal-minded daughter for realizing;

>Today our daughter has changed her  tune drastically. She now says Trump may have been somewhat abrasive,  but his policies all benefited the USA. She sees Biden tearing America  apart, piece by piece, in a rush toward disaster.

and that;

>I'm  very proud of my little girl. She doesn't drink the popular Kool-Aid of  the Libbies. She analyzes, compares, and reaches the only rational  conclusion.

The reason REDDIT gave for the 7 day site-wide ban;

>Your account has been suspended from Reddit for ***harassment***. The suspension will last 7 day(s).

I gravitated to this sub because its mission is to *reform* the Democrat party. But REDDIT has evidently decided that if anyone does not adhere to the orthodoxy of **The Woke**, they are harassing people and polluting their minds with...what...dangerous ideas of independence?

Another thing REDDIT does, is dish out these arbitrary bannings under the guise of an *automated bot*. The gutless wonders don't even have the personal fortitude to stand behind their own decisions, so they hide behind a bot.

So I'm gonna leave my account till the weekend, to see if I get banned for posting this...ever so dangerous OP and to see what responses there may be to this. For those of you out there who truly believe in arcane and dangerous ideas like *free speech* and *the free exchange of ideas*, I would implore you to find another place to go. I'm gonna try Parler and see what its all about.

It is the great **LIE** of **The Woke**, that things like *inclusion*, *unity, fairness, the laws of the land*...mean anything to them. They do not! What is paramount to **The Woke**...is the blind adherence to their orthodoxy. A purely *racist, communist, hateful* ideology that if left unchecked...is going to destroy the United States of America.

I will NOT be a party to that so...I choose to leave this cesspool called...REDDIT.",m1xljw,10,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Democrat/comments/m1xljw/the_great_lie_of_the_woke/
